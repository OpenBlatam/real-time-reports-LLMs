ok I need you to implement the prds/active/$ARGUMENTS.md prd following it in 
order and accomplishing the tasks while referencing the prd, its notes, and recommendations.

make sure to mark off completed tasks as you go.

you should follow best practices as related in documentation/ for database migrations, testing.mdc, handlers.mdc, 
etc. Please analyze them before you modify a file.

Particularly you should always reference: documentation/testing.mdc before writing tests.

please analyze all files before proceeding with any implementations.

feel free to explore the codebase while implementing the prd.

you should think hard about your implementation and then implement carefully.

you are not done until the tests for your specific file are finished and run successfully and a cargo check runs successfully.

please reference the prd frequently to ensure you are on track with the work..
